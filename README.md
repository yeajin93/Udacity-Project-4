# Project Introduction

This is the Wikipedia definition:

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence
> concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to
> process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

You could spend years and get a masters degree focusing on the details of creating NLP systems and algorithms. Typically, NLP programs require far more resources than individuals have access to, but a fairly new API called Aylien has put a public facing API in front of their NLP system. We will use it in this project to determine various attributes of an article or blog post.

## To Run Project

First, run npm install. After, you would have to open two terminals:

- In the first terminal, build and start the webpack dev server at port 8080. Type 'npm run build-dev' in the first terminal

- In the second terminal, generate a `dist` folder for prod by running 'npm run build-prod' and run the Express server on port 8081 using 'npm start'.

## Dependencies

- Aylien API
- HTML
- CSS
- Sass
- JavaScript
- Webpack
- Babel
- Express
